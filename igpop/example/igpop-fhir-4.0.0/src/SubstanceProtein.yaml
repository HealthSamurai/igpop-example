description: A SubstanceProtein is defined as a single unit of a linear amino acid sequence, or a combination of subunits that are either covalently linked or have a defined invariant stoichiometric relationship. This includes all synthetic, recombinant and purified SubstanceProteins of defined sequence, whether the use is therapeutic or prophylactic. This set of elements will be used to describe albumins, coagulation factors, cytokines, growth factors, peptide/SubstanceProtein hormones, enzymes, toxins, toxoids, recombinant vaccines, and immunomodulators.

    description: The disulphide bond between two cysteine residues either on the same subunit or on two different subunits shall be described. The position of the disulfide bonds in the SubstanceProtein shall be listed in increasing order of subunit number and position within subunit followed by the abbreviation of the amino acids involved. The disulfide linkage positions shall actually contain the amino acid Cysteine at the respective positions

    description: This subclause refers to the description of each subunit constituting the SubstanceProtein. A subunit is a linear sequence of amino acids linked through peptide bonds. The Subunit information shall be provided when the finished SubstanceProtein is a complex of multiple sequences; subunits are not used to delineate domains within a single sequence. Subunits are listed in order of decreasing length; sequences of the same length will be ordered by decreasing molecular weight; subunits that have identical sequences will be repeated multiple times

      sequence:
        description: The sequence information shall be provided enumerating the amino acids from N- to C-terminal end using standard single-letter amino acid codes. Uppercase shall be used for L-amino acids and lowercase for D-amino acids. Transcribed SubstanceProteins will always be described using the translated sequence; for synthetic peptide containing amino acids that are not represented with a single letter code an X should be used within the sequence. The modified amino acids will be distinguished by their position in the sequence
