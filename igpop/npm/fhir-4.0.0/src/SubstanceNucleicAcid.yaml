    description: 'The number of linear sequences of nucleotides linked through phosphodiester bonds shall be described. Subunits would be strands of nucleic acids that are tightly associated typically through Watson-Crick base pairing. NOTE: If not specified in the reference source, the assumption is that there is 1 subunit'

    description: 'The area of hybridisation shall be described if applicable for double stranded RNA or DNA. The number associated with the subunit followed by the number associated to the residue shall be specified in increasing order.
