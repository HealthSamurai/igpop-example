description: 'Base StructureDefinition for SubstanceAmount Type: Chemical substances are a single substance type whose primary defining element is the molecular structure. Chemical substances shall be defined on the basis of their complete covalent molecular structure; the presence of a salt (counter-ion) and/or solvates (water, alcohols) is also captured. Purity, grade, physical form or particle size are not taken into account in the definition of a chemical substance or in the assignment of a Substance ID.'

  amount:
    description: Used to capture quantitative values for a variety of elements. If only limits are given, the arithmetic mean would be the average. If only a single definite value for a given element is given, it would be captured in this field
    union: [Quantity, Range, string]
  amountType:
    description: 'Most elements that require a quantitative value will also have a field called amount type. Amount type should always be specified because the actual value of the amount is often dependent on it. EXAMPLE: In capturing the actual relative amounts of substances or molecular fragments it is essential to indicate whether the amount refers to a mole ratio or weight ratio. For any given element an effort should be made to use same the amount type for all related definitional elements'
